# Multiple-Face-Recognition-in-Videos
Using Deep Learning for Multiple Face Recognition (Face Detection + Face Tagging)

# Requirements
You need to install `pillow`,`dlib` and `face-recognition` libraries. To install them on you windows, follow the codes bellow in cmd.
```bash
pip install pillow
pip install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install face-recognition
```
Make sure that you have Visual Studio 2015 (or newer) on your windows.

# Features To do
- use different photos of a person from different angles and assign their name, using people dataset
- save data into textfile
- use webcam live video
- detect multiple faces in each frame
- match the Faces with extracted data
- calculate the similarity of faces between given radius r1 and r2.
